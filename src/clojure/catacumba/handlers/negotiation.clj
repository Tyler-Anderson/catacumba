(ns catacumba.handlers.negotiation
  "Content negotiation.

  In the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), content negotiation is the mechanism that is used,
  when facing the ability to serve several equivalent contents for a given URI, to provide the best
  suited one to the final user. The determination of the best suited content is made through one of
  three mechanisms:

  1. Specific HTTP headers by the client (server-driven negotiation)
  2. The 300 Multiple Choices or 406 Not Acceptable HTTP response codes by the server (agent-driven
  negotiation)
  3. Cache (transparent negotiation).

  This module implements the agent-driven negotiation."
